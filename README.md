# LoPT
Good tools ought to be shared.

---

LoPT stands for `Lab. of Physics Tool`, and it is a plugin designed to speed up operations when visiting http://166.111.214.78/.

## Methodology

Using automatic scripts to scramble for limited resources is never a decent conduct.

This userscript goes a different direction, intended to speed up operations by simply enhancing user experience when visiting the site.

In this case, all operations remain basically manual, but users can also gain a higher chance of getting their desired courses.

## What to expect?

### Faster login

Upon logged in, the user will be automatically redirected to the latest course selection page.

### Faster selection

Users no longer have to press enter or push button to confirm a registration - a registration request will be automatically sent to server as soon as the user clicks a radio button.

## Warning

This script has never been in use! (In fact, I myself have never ever been able to reserve a single session! Under extreme anger, I decided to write and share this script.) 

## Usage

- First, install an userscript manager for your browser. Recommended are:
  - [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
  - [Violentmonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)
  - [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
  - [Violentmonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)
- Then, go to [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/UNIDY/LoPT) for installation.
